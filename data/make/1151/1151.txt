the minimums in stress and temperature, below which grain boundary motion does not occur, increase regularly with the copper content as would be expected if recovery is necessary for movement. otherwise the effects, if any, of the copper solute upon grain boundary displacement and its rate are too small for identification by the experimental technique employed.
