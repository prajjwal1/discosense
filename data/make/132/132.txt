the scientific framework for nanocomposite magnetic materials that make high frequency components possible will be presented in terms of the materials paradigm of synthesis structure properties performance. in particular novel processing and the control of phase transformations and ultimately nanostructures has relied on the ability to probe structures on a nanoscale.
