as the polymeric quantization is the characteristic feature of loop quantum gravity, we will argue that this calculation will indicate the effect on the holographic principle from the loop quantum gravity. thus we will be able to explicitly demonstrate the violation of the holographic principle in the loop quantum gravity.
