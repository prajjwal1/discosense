this finding establishes a link between two proteins that can cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis when mutated, vapb als 8 and p 97 als 14. subsequently we identified a similar ffat like motif in the asna 1 subunit of the transmembrane domain recognition complex, which in turn mediates asna 1 interaction with the msp domain of vapb.
