a second one of the fluxes travels to the opposed distal end 66 and back to the first proximal end 68 in the inner conduit 60 of the injector 36. thus the incoming flux is separated into two fluxes which travel separately to an opposed distal end 66 of the injector 36 and back to the first proximal end 68.
