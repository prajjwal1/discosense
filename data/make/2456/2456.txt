consequently, the region of the chalcogenide material layer that is heated by joule heat is expanded therefore, a larger current is required for crystallizing or amorphizing the chalcogenide material layer. thereby the interface layer comprising the semiconductor is desired to be amorphous rather than being polycrystalline.
