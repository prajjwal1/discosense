we note that we used a similar barium precipitation method for sulfate measurement and therefore cannot account for the peculiarly low sulfate values reported in that paper. in contrast we noted less than 1 mmol d of thiosulfate in the urine of our study participants, and found that excreted sulfate was approximately equimolar with the amount of thiosulfate administered.
