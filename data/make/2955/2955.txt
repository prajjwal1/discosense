i especially wish to say this, because, as an anti darwinian, i must add, that i have not been in the least convinced by anything that mr. warington has advanced. on the contrary after hearing his arguments, i feel if possible only the more persuaded that the theory of mr. darwin is inharmonious, inadequate, inconsistent, and utterly incredible.
