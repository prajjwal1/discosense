however, in this case, although incorporation or coupling efficiency may be restored, there may still be problems of the coupling efficiencies of attachment of the desired group to the allylamine. for instance coupling of labels to allylamine moieties in a nucleic acid is dramatically less efficient for double stranded dna compared to single stranded targets.
