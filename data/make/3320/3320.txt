dynamic contrasts are striking and often abrupt, sections of chamber like transparency are set against powerful orchestral tutti, much chromaticism, wide interval leaps and a joy in counterpoint. in short a must for anyone who enjoys the fermenting, overheated musical atmosphere which produced berg, the early schoenberg, schreker, zemlinsky, the early hindemith and krenekwell, you get the idea.
