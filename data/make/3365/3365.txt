in europe music was often played in churches, and churches have a deep echo, so composers avoided percussive sounds and tended to favor slow chord progressions. by contrast music in africa was played outdoors and had to be loud enough to be heard over the sound of dancing and socializing, so musicians there tended to pick drums.
