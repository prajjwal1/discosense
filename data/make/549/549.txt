bondsy, founded by a long haired, bearded, and brazilian diego zambrano, lets users trade anything they own for anything their network has to offer. yet unlike zaarly, taskrabbit, or other peer to peer marketplaces, bondsy tries to take the focus away from money, and place the real value of the service on the experiences.
