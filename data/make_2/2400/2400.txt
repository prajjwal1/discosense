the terrorist case doesnt fit this symmetric model rather the problem is that there are great many actions the terrorists can take, and the preparations dont require vast amounts of communication. by contrast domestic dissidents and illegal businesses are more vulnerable, since they need to communicate to keep operating, and they dont have nearly as much in the way of countermeasures.
