our group thus takes microfluidics and nanofabrication as the main technical approaches to investigate emerging challenges in multiphase processes. particularly we are interested in microvascular blood flow, multiphase flow including micrometer diameter gas bubbles, liquid droplets, and nano microparticles for synthesis of drug delivery materials, and photocatalytic multiphase reactions.
