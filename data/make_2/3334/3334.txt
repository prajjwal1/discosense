ae before i turned to photography, i studied painting and art history for years i used to spend hours in the met or moma just looking at paintings and nothing else. in particular i still love the early dutch and early american paintings that depict wealthy subjects against dark velvet drapes and lavish environments, the moody stillness in the light and shadow.
