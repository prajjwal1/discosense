developing this system will allow visigen researchers to identify pathogens and enable comprehensive genome analysis, with a specific aim to design, build and test the next generation single molecule dna sequencing instrument. subsequently this instrument will be used for beta testing by various houston researchers, whose feedback will be incorporated into future phases of technology development.
