this is because it is impractical to run the engine fuel rich or near stoichiometric to release and reduce nox. hence using such nox traps in gasoline lean burn engine exhaust systems is more commercially appropriate since the air fuel ratio can more conveniently be made stoichiometric or fuel rich.
