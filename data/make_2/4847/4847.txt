with the breakthrough of the contoured surface, the researchers were able to control the micro scale discharge to produce maximum airflow without risk of sparks or electrical arcing. as a result the new device yields a breeze as swift as 2.4 meters per second, as compared to airflows of g 7 to 1.7 meters per second from larger, mechanical fans.
