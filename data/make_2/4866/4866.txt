however, i vigorously disagree with finras conclusion that this injustice should be extended to arbitrations and litigation that fail to name the financial advisor as a party. instead i believe finra should propose to end the reporting of all unsubstantiated claims of wrongdoing to the public and allow honest and decent financial advisors to retain their hard earned reputations.
