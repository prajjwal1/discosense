in drosophila, formation of aversive olfactory long term memory requires multiple training sessions pairing odor and electric shock punishment with rest intervals. in contrast here we show that a single 2 min training session pairing odor with a more ethologically relevant sugar reinforcement forms long term appetitive memory that lasts for days.
