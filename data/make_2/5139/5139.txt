the present invention provides methods for manufacture of autograft, allograft and xenograft implants by assembling such implants from smaller pieces of graft materials to form a larger graft implant product. as a result increased utilization of valuable implant materials is achieved, thereby more effectively meeting the ever increasing demands for graft implant materials.
