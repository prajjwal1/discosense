the decrease in the resistance is further enhanced by the addition of ch 4, although more volume change is expected because of the increased crystalline si phase content. as a result the core shell sio nanocomposite produced by plasma spraying with ch 4 becomes advantageous in attaining high capacity and high retention efficiency simultaneously.
