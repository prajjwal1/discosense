incubation with rage ligands revealed that rage null or endothelial dn rage mice endothelial cells were highly resistant to upregulation of inflammatory factors and matrix metalloproteinases. interestingly these experiments demonstrated that oxidized ldl contains age epitopes which at least in part transduce proinflammatory signaling via rage in endothelial cells.
