together, the rnai and clip seq data demonstrate the potential for regulation of a substantial portion perhaps a majority of emt regulated exons by these three factors. thus our data are consistent with a model in which several splicing factors collaborate in the regulation of splicing during emt, adding a layer of post transcriptional regulation to the emt program.
