all of the truncated structures promoted frameshifting at levels equal to or greater than the wild type pseudoknot structure using a dual luciferase reporter assay. interestingly the l 2 tetras 3 4 bp mutant stimulated frameshifting at 25.1% compared to the 15 to 17.5% observed for the other stem 3 mutants.
